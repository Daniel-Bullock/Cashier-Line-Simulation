# Cashier Line Simulation

This project simulates a cashier line where customers are processed by registers, including a training register. The goal is to determine how long it takes for all customers to be processed based on their arrival time, number of items, and the type of register they use.

To run the simulation with a specific test case file, use the following command:

```bash
./build/main.exe testcases/test1.txt
```

To run the unit tests, use the following command:
```bash
./build/test.exe
```
